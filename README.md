### CSC2035 Completed Assignment - systems programming and inter-process communication (IPC) 

Introduction

For this assignment I was provided with a partially completed project to demonstrate different approaches to maintaining the integrity of an inter-process communication (IPC) application. 
My task was to complete the project by implementing supporting library functions. It helped me to reinforce, in practice, the operating systems theory I learnt as part of the CSC2035 module.
