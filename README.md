## Completed CSC2035 Assignment - systems programming and inter-process communication (IPC) 

Introduction

For this assignment I was provided with a partially completed project to demonstrate different approaches to maintaining the integrity of an inter-process communication (IPC) application (busy waiting and semaphore approaches). 
My task was to complete the project by implementing supporting library functions. It helped me to reinforce, in practice, the operating systems theory I learnt as part of the CSC2035 module.
