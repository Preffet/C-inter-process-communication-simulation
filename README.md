### CSC2035 Completed Assignment - systems programming and inter-process communication (IPC) 

Introduction

For this assignment you are provided with a partially completed project to demonstrate different approaches to maintaining the integrity of an inter-process communication (IPC) application. The IPC application is a collection of multiple process that communicate via a queue of jobs that is allocated in shared memory (see Section 5).

Your task is to complete the project by implementing supporting library functions (see Section 7).

The project demonstrates both busy waiting and semaphore approaches to maintaining integrity of IPC applications. This will reinforce, in practice, the operating systems theory you will learn as part of this module.
